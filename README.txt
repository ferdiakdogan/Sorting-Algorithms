1 - Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is an algorithm to sort a list through repeated swaps of 
adjacent elements. It has a runtime of O(n^2).

For nearly sorted lists, bubble sort performs relatively few operations 
since it only performs a swap when elements are out of order.

Bubble sort is a good introductory algorithm which opens the door to 
learning more complex algorithms. It answers the question, “How can we 
algorithmically sort a list?” and encourages us to ask, “How can we 
improve this sorting algorithm?”

2 - Merge Sort:
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm created by John von Neumann in 1945. 
Merge sort’s “killer app” was the strategy that breaks the 
list-to-be-sorted into smaller parts, sometimes called a divide-and-conquer 
algorithm.

In a divide-and-conquer algorithm, the data is continually broken down 
into smaller elements until sorting them becomes really simple.

Merge sort was the first of many sorts that use this strategy, and is 
still in use today in many different applications.
